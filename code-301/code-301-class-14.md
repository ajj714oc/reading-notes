What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?
During the decline of women in computer science, there was a concurrent rise in the intimidation of males associated with computer usage, notably from 1980 onwards.

Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?
The prevalence of males playing on computers growing up mattered significantly because it shaped perceptions, with advertisements predominantly depicting men, influencing societal views on gender roles.

When are diversity efforts most successful?
Diverse companies perform better because they can better engage with a diverse user base, leading to improved outcomes both within their communities and among peers.

Why do diverse companies perform better?
You are able to get more engaged with the users who are also diversed.  Along with that, you get better outcomes when diversity plays a big factor not only within the community but also among peers.

Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.
For example, a diverse company can effectively serve a diverse user base by understanding and resonating with various perspectives. A personal illustration is my experience as a US Veteran who served in multiple branches, allowing me to connect with fellow veterans in ways that someone who hasn't served cannot fully comprehend. This underscores the power of diversity in reaching and serving diverse audiences effectively.
