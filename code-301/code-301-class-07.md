## 3. How does pair programming work?

Pair programming typically involves two developers working together at the same computer, with one assuming the role of the "driver" and the other as the "navigator." Here's how it typically works:

1. **Driver:** The driver is the one actively writing code. They are responsible for typing code into the computer, implementing the solution, and handling the mechanics of programming.
2. **Navigator:** The navigator is responsible for reviewing the code as it's being written. They focus on the big picture, thinking strategically about the overall design, identifying potential issues, suggesting improvements, and guiding the direction of the coding session.
The roles of driver and navigator are not fixed and can be switched frequently, depending on the preferences of the pair and the needs of the task at hand. Effective pair programming sessions involve constant communication and collaboration between the two developers, with each offering their insights, expertise, and feedback.
Pair programming sessions often follow these general steps:

1.**Discuss Requirements:** The pair starts by discussing the requirements of the task or user story they are working on. They clarify any ambiguities, define the desired outcome, and agree on a plan of action.
2.**Set Up Environment:** The pair sets up their development environment, ensuring that they have everything they need to start coding, such as the necessary tools, libraries, and access to relevant resources.
3.**Start Coding:** The driver begins coding, while the navigator actively observes and provides feedback. The navigator may ask questions, suggest alternative approaches, or point out potential issues as the code is being written.
4.**Switch Roles:** After a certain period or milestone, the pair may choose to switch roles. The navigator becomes the driver, and vice versa. This allows both developers to contribute actively to the coding process and prevents fatigue or burnout from prolonged periods of coding.
5.**Continuous Communication:** Throughout the session, the pair maintains open communication, discussing their thoughts, ideas, and any challenges they encounter. They collaborate closely to ensure that the code meets the requirements and follows best practices.
6.**Review and Refactor:** Once the coding task is complete, the pair reviews the code together, looking for opportunities to refactor, optimize, or improve readability. They may also write unit tests to ensure the code's correctness and maintainability.
Overall, pair programming is a collaborative and iterative process that emphasizes teamwork, communication, and shared responsibility for the codebase. It promotes knowledge sharing, enhances code quality, and fosters a supportive and collaborative working environment.
