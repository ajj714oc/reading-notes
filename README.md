# Growth Mindset

## What is "*Growth Mindset*"?

> In my personal opinion; it's what you have established in a mental and emotional stability. I think it is how you perceive yourself and as well as your situation with the intended destination along a path that will progress through time of successes and failures. It's the core of what and how you grow as you learn through the process.

1. **Vision**- to keep focus.
1. **Commitment**- never giving up when the roadblocks or challenges come.
1. **Endurance**- to see yourself through it all as you strive for excellence.

## Understanding of Relational Databases

Relational databases are a type of database management system (DBMS) that organizes data into tables, where each table represents an entity, and each row represents a record of that entity. These tables are related to each other through common fields, allowing for the establishment of relationships between them.

## Key Concepts

Tables: Also known as relations, tables store data in rows and columns.
Relationships: Relationships define how tables are related to each other, such as one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many relationships.
Normalization: Normalization is the process of organizing data to minimize redundancy and dependency, ensuring data integrity and efficiency.
SQL (Structured Query Language): SQL is the standard language used to interact with relational databases. It consists of various commands and statements for querying, manipulating, and managing data.
Understanding of SQL:

SQL is a powerful language for managing relational databases. It allows users to perform a wide range of operations, including querying data, inserting new records, updating existing records, and deleting records.

## Common SQL Commands

SELECT: Retrieves data from one or more tables based on specified criteria.
INSERT: Adds new records to a table.
UPDATE: Modifies existing records in a table.
DELETE: Removes records from a table.
CREATE TABLE: Creates a new table with specified columns and constraints.
ALTER TABLE: Modifies an existing table structure, such as adding or dropping columns.
JOIN: Combines data from multiple tables based on a related column.
Summary of Lessons:

Through the lessons, we've gained a comprehensive understanding of relational databases and SQL. We've learned how to create and modify database tables, query data using SELECT statements, and perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). Additionally, we've explored advanced SQL concepts such as joins and aggregation functions.

## Challenges Faced

While learning SQL, some challenges were encountered, particularly in understanding complex JOIN operations and writing efficient queries. However, with practice and perseverance, these challenges were overcome, leading to a deeper understanding of SQL fundamentals.

## Conclusion

Relational databases and SQL are fundamental components of modern data management systems. By mastering SQL, users can effectively manage and manipulate data, extract valuable insights, and make informed decisions based on data analysis. The lessons learned have provided a solid foundation for further exploration and application of relational databases and SQL in real-world scenarios.
