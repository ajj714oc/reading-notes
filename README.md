# Growth Mindset
### What is "*Growth Mindset*"? 
> In my personal opinion; it's what you have established in a mental and emotional stability. I think it is how you perceive yourself and as well as your situation with the intended destination along a path that will progress through time of successes and failures. It's the core of what and how you grow as you learn through the process. 

1. **Vision**- to keep focus.
1. **Commitment**- never giving up when the roadblocks or challenges come.
1. **Endurance**- to see yourself through it all as you strive for excellence.

Stretch Goals

My name is Adam Jimenez. I am a **U.S. Navy Veteran** and also have served in the **CA Army National Guard**. After I was Honarably discharged from both branches, I decided to go to Orange Coast College to pursue Graphic Design. I also have photography experience such as Macy's Fashion shows, weddings, portraits, as well as events and landscapes. 

I had my own business printing apparel, canopies, business cards, table covers and glass etching promotional items for personal and businesses. I have shipped products all over the U.S. and some parts of Canada. It was a word of mouth and self promoting that allowed me to gain the notoriety from customers afar!

I am highly interested in **Full-Stack Development** as it will help enhance my skill-set and vision I hold dear. I have the ambition, capability and determination to continue to spark interests of others that I can collaborate with. I enjoy being creative, outspoken and a bit artsy with my work! I am looking forward to working others as I progress in the field!
