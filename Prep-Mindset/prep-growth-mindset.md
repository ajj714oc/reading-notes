## Upgrade Your Technical Skills with Deliberate Practice

"Delving into the concept of deliberate practice can feel a bit daunting at first, especially if it's not fully understood. However, its essence lies in something more tangible: focused, intentional efforts to enhance specific skills. In my case, I can relate this to my programming journey, particularly in tasks like CRUD operations.

While I may not grasp the intricacies of deliberate practice yet, I do recognize its importance in skill improvement. For me, this means dedicating time to work on tasks related to creating, reading, updating, and deleting data in programming. As I navigate through this concept, I'm starting to see how deliberate practice aligns with my learning goals and how it can propel me forward in my programming journey.

Although I'm still in the process of understanding deliberate practice fully, I'm determined to explore it further and integrate it into my learning routine. With each step I take, I'm gaining more clarity and confidence in how deliberate practice can significantly impact my technical skills."

## Carol Dweck on the Growth Mindset

In the video featuring Carol Dweck discussing the Growth Mindset, she emphasizes the power of language in shaping our attitudes towards success and failure. Dweck suggests reframing the concept of failure by replacing it with the phrase "not yet." This simple linguistic shift implies that while success may not have been achieved at a certain point in time, there is still potential for growth and improvement in the future.
Dweck illustrates this point by highlighting examples of individuals, such as Native Americans, who have faced significant challenges but persevered to excel beyond expectations. By adopting a growth mindset, these individuals were able to overcome obstacles and achieve remarkable success.
Dweck's insights underscore the importance of cultivating a mindset that embraces challenges and views setbacks as opportunities for growth. By reframing failure as a temporary setback rather than a permanent outcome, individuals can cultivate resilience and motivation to continue striving towards their goals.

## Angela Lee Duckworth on Grit

In Angela Lee Duckworth's talk on grit, she recounts her journey from being a teacher to delving into the study of grit and its impact on success. Duckworth explains how her experience of observing students' responses to tests sparked her curiosity about the factors that truly determine achievement.
As a teacher, Duckworth noticed that standardized test scores didn't always align with what she expected in terms of students' future success. This discrepancy prompted her to leave teaching and pursue research on the topic of grit â€“ the combination of passion and perseverance towards long-term goals.
Through her research, Duckworth conducted studies, including ones at West Point, to understand how grit influences outcomes. She found that traditional measures of talent or intelligence often fell short in predicting who would succeed. Instead, she discovered that grittier individuals, those who displayed determination and resilience, were more likely to achieve their goals despite facing challenges.
Duckworth's findings challenge conventional notions of success and highlight the importance of qualities like grit in achieving one's aspirations. Her work underscores the value of perseverance and dedication in overcoming obstacles and achieving long-term success.

## Alain de Botton on Redefining Success

In Alain de Botton's discussion on redefining success, he delves into the complex nature of envy and its relationship to our perceptions of equality and achievement. De Botton challenges the notion that equality necessarily leads to contentment, suggesting instead that envy often arises from comparisons with those we consider our equals.
Drawing from personal experience, De Botton reflects on the dynamics of envy within social contexts, such as school reunions. He observes that while attendees may appear equal in terms of their shared educational background, they differ significantly in their individual accomplishments and life trajectories. This discrepancy can fuel feelings of envy and dissatisfaction, highlighting the inherent complexity of comparing oneself to others.
Furthermore, De Botton touches upon the notion of success evolving over time. As individuals mature, their definitions of success may shift, and they may come to realize that achieving success in one aspect of life does not guarantee fulfillment in all areas. De Botton emphasizes the impossibility of being successful at everything, suggesting that true contentment lies in accepting and embracing the inherent limitations of human achievement.
Overall, De Botton's insights encourage a reevaluation of traditional notions of success and offer a nuanced perspective on the complexities of envy, equality, and personal fulfillment. By acknowledging the inevitability of envy and recognizing the limitations of individual success, individuals can cultivate a more holistic understanding of achievement and happiness.

## your emotional intelligence

"I find it challenging to connect with others and trust them to support my ideas and goals. This difficulty stems from past experiences where people let me down or I felt unsupported, leading me to believe that relying on others would only get in the way of what I'm trying to achieve.
To address this, I'm reflecting on these past experiences and identifying patterns that influence my current mindset. I'm working on challenging the negative beliefs I hold about seeking support and recognizing that not everyone will behave the same way.
I'm practicing vulnerability by gradually opening up and sharing my thoughts with trusted individuals. I'm also setting boundaries and communicating my needs effectively in relationships. Additionally, I'm considering seeking support from a therapist or counselor to explore these challenges further and develop coping strategies.
I understand that building meaningful connections takes time and effort, so I'm being patient with myself and celebrating small victories along the way. With practice and self-awareness, I'm confident that I can develop the skills and confidence to connect with others and cultivate supportive relationships."

## your biases

"My strongest area is understanding bias and how to act upon it. I've developed a good understanding of what bias is and have learned four effective ways to address it. However, I recognize that I have weaknesses in the areas of bias and identity, empathy and curiosity, and creating meaningful connections.
One area I'm particularly focused on improving is creating meaningful connections with others. I've noticed that I struggle to establish deep, meaningful relationships, and I want to work on this aspect of myself.
To achieve this, I'm committing to seeking out opportunities to connect with others in genuine and authentic ways. I'll practice active listening, genuinely engaging with others' experiences and perspectives. I'll also seek common ground with others and be willing to share my own thoughts and feelings openly and vulnerably.
Building meaningful connections is important to me because I believe that strong relationships enrich our lives and contribute to our overall well-being. I'm dedicated to putting in the effort to improve in this area and look forward to seeing the positive impact it will have on my life."
