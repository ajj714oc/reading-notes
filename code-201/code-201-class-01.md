*Describe how HTML, CSS, and JS files are “parsed” in the browser.

The html, is the structure of any website in which is in out in the public. It is like the keel or form of foundation that is established. The CSS(Cascading Style Sheet), is the cosmetic of the html and it decorates it! The Java Script comes along and brings the functionality of it. It is the mechanism that makes the website go from static to interactive with the user’s input when prompted.

*How can you find images to add to a Website?

To find images, they can either be searched on web browsers through search bars, websites such as (Shutterstock,Adobe Stock, Getty Images, Unsplash, Pexels, Pixaby), your own photography, free image libraries like(Free Images, Stock Snap, Bursty by Shopify, Gratisography), Google Images with Usage Rights Filter, Icon and Vector Websites, your own graphic design software or apps,  and paid photography services.

*How do you create a String vs a Number in JavaScript?

The keyword difference between a string and a number is: DATA Types.

A string is a sequence of characters, such as letters, digits, symbols, or spaces, enclosed within quotation marks (single or double) in programming languages like JavaScript, Python, or Java.
Strings are typically used to represent text or textual data.
Examples of strings: "Hello, world!", "123", "apple", etc.
Operations on strings usually involve concatenation (joining strings together), searching for substrings, or manipulating the text data.

A number represents numerical data and can be either an integer or a floating-point        number (decimal).
Numbers are used for mathematical calculations, counting, measurements, and more.
Examples of numbers: 42, 3.14, -10, etc.
Operations on numbers typically involve arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc.Strings represent textual data enclosed within quotes, while numbers represent numerical data for arithmetic operations and calculations. It's important to distinguish between them, as they have different behaviors and purposes in programming.

*What is a Variable and why are they important in JavaScript.

 A variable is a container for storing data values. Variables are used to store various types of data, such as numbers, strings, objects, arrays, functions, and more. They play a crucial role in programming because they allow developers to store and manipulate data dynamically within their programs.
Here are some key aspects of variables in JavaScript and why they are important:
Storage of Data: Variables provide a way to store data values in memory during the execution of a program. This allows developers to access and manipulate data throughout the program's execution.
Dynamic Typing: JavaScript is a dynamically-typed language, meaning that variables can hold values of any data type. This flexibility allows developers to work with different types of data without needing to specify the type explicitly.
Data Manipulation: Variables enable developers to perform various operations on data, such as arithmetic calculations, string manipulation, array operations, and more. By storing data in variables, developers can easily modify and transform it as needed.
Scope: Variables can have different scopes, which determine where in the program they can be accessed. Understanding variable scope is important for writing maintainable and bug-free code.
Reuse and Readability: Using variables makes code more readable and understandable. Instead of repeating literal values throughout the code, developers can assign those values to variables with descriptive names, making the code easier to understand and maintain.
Dynamic Behavior: Variables can change their value during the execution of a program, allowing for dynamic behavior. This enables developers to create interactive and responsive applications.
Overall, variables are essential in JavaScript (and in programming in general) because they enable developers to work with data in a flexible and efficient manner, leading to the creation of dynamic and functional applications.
keyword is used to declare a variable. In modern JavaScript, let is preferred over var for declaring variables due to its block-level scope.
The variable name (e.g., age, name, isStudent) is followed by an assignment operator (=), which assigns a value to the variable.
The value assigned to the variable can be of any data type: number, string, boolean, array, object, or function.

*Read the beginning of Getting Started with HTML Start from the

  beginning and read through section “Anatomy of an HTML document”.

*What is an HTML attribute?

 In HTML, attributes are additional properties that can be added to HTML elements to provide additional information about those elements. Attributes are always specified in the opening tag of an HTML element and are written as name-value pairs, where the name is the attribute name and the value is the attribute value.

Describe the Anatomy of an HTMl element.

 Opening Tag:
The opening tag is the first part of the HTML element and marks the beginning of the element's content.

Attributes:
Attributes provide additional information about the element.
They are specified within the opening tag and are written as name-value pairs.
Attributes are separated by spaces and typically have a name followed by an equal sign (=) and a value enclosed in double or single quotes.

Attribute Name:
Identifies the specific characteristic or property of the element.
Examples: href, src, alt, class, id, etc.
Attribute Value:
Specifies the value associated with the attribute.
Values can be text, URLs, numbers, or other types depending on the attribute.

Content:
The content of an HTML element is the information enclosed between the opening and closing tags.
It can include text, other HTML elements, or a combination of both.
Closing Tag:
The closing tag marks the end of the element's content.
It consists of the element name preceded by a forward slash (/) and enclosed in angle brackets (< and >).
Not all elements have closing tags; some are self-closing or void elements.
Example: </div>, </p>, </a>, </img>, etc.
Self-Closing Tag (Void Elements):
Some elements in HTML don't have any content and are self-closing.
They consist of a single tag without a closing tag.

What is the Difference between article and section element tags?

article Element:
The article element represents a self-contained piece of content that could potentially be distributed and reused independently.
It typically contains content that is standalone and can be considered as an individual item, such as blog posts, news articles, forum posts, comments, or other similar content.
It's important to note that an article should be able to stand alone and make sense even if it's separated from the rest of the content on the page.
section Element:
The section element is a generic container for grouping related content together.
It is used to divide the content of a page into thematic sections or components.
Unlike the article element, the content within a section doesn't necessarily need to be standalone or independent.
It's often used to organize content into different parts, such as chapters, sections of an article, or different segments of a webpage.
In summary, the key difference between article and section lies in their semantic meaning and the nature of the content they contain. Use article for standalone, independently distributable content, and section for grouping related content together within a larger document.

What Elements does a “typical” website include?

 The Header (header), Navigation (nav), Main Content (main), Sidebar (aside), Footer (footer), Sections (section), Articles (article), Headings (h1, h2,h3,h4,h5,h6), Paragraphs (p) and Links (a) are the common elements on a website.

How does metadata influence Search Engine Optimization?

.Metadata plays a crucial role in Search Engine Optimization (SEO) because it provides valuable information to search engines about the content and context of a web page. Here's how different types of metadata influence SEO:
Title Tag:
The title tag (title) is one of the most important metadata elements for SEO.
It appears in the browser's title bar and is displayed as the clickable headline in search engine results.
Including relevant keywords in the title tag helps search engines understand the topic of the page and improves its visibility in search results.
It's essential to keep the title tag concise, descriptive, and relevant to the content of the page.
Meta Description:
The meta description (meta name="description") is a brief summary of the page's content.
While it doesn't directly impact search rankings, a well-crafted meta description can entice users to click on the search result.
Including relevant keywords and a clear call-to-action in the meta description can improve click-through rates (CTR) and indirectly impact SEO.
Meta Keywords:
Historically, meta keywords (meta name="keywords") were used to indicate the primary keywords of a page.
However, search engines like Google no longer consider meta keywords as a ranking factor due to abuse and manipulation.
Including meta keywords is no longer necessary for SEO and may even be ignored by search engines.
Meta Robots:
The meta robots tag (meta name="robots") instructs search engine crawlers on how to index and display the page.
Common directives include "index" (allow indexing) and "nofollow" (prevent following links on the page).
Proper usage of meta robots can control how search engines crawl and index the content, ensuring that only relevant pages are included in search results.
Canonical Tag:
The canonical tag (link rel="canonical") specifies the preferred version of a web page when multiple URLs contain similar or duplicate content.
It helps prevent duplicate content issues and consolidates link equity (ranking power) to the preferred URL.
Implementing canonical tags correctly can prevent dilution of search engine rankings and improve the overall SEO performance of the website.
By optimizing metadata elements like title tags, meta descriptions, and canonical tags, website owners can improve the visibility and relevance of their pages in search engine results, ultimately driving more organic traffic to their websites.

How is the meta HTML tag used when specifying metadata?

The meta HTML tag is used to specify metadata about an HTML document. Metadata provides information about the document that is not displayed directly on the page but is important for browsers, search engines, and other web applications. The meta tag is a self-closing tag and does not have a closing tag.
Here are some common use cases for the meta tag and how it is used to specify metadata:
Character Encoding:
The charset attribute specifies the character encoding used in the document.
Example: meta charset="UTF-8"
Viewport Settings:
The viewport meta tag is used to control the layout and scaling of the viewport on mobile devices.
Example: meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"
Page Description:
The description attribute provides a brief description of the page's content. This description is often displayed in search engine results.
Example: meta name="description" content="This is a brief description of the page content."
Keywords (Obsolete):
The keywords attribute used to specify keywords relevant to the page's content. However, this attribute is no longer considered by major search engines like Google for ranking purposes.
Example: meta name="keywords" content="keyword1, keyword2, keyword3"
Author Information:
The author attribute specifies the author of the document.
Example: meta name="author" content="John Doe"
Viewport Settings:
The viewport meta tag is used to control the layout and scaling of the viewport on mobile devices.
Example: meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"
Robots Meta Tag:
The robots attribute controls how search engines index and display the page.
Example: meta name="robots" content="index, follow"
Canonical Link:
The canonical attribute specifies the canonical URL of the page, indicating the preferred version of the content when there are multiple URLs with similar or duplicate content.

These are just a few examples of how the meta tag is used to specify metadata in an HTML document. By including relevant metadata, web developers can improve the accessibility, search engine visibility, and overall user experience of their web pages.

How to start to design a Website?

The first step to design a website is to right it down. Make a layout of what you want to do with the website and what purpose it serves.

The first step to design a website is to right it down. Make a layout of what you want to do with the website and what purpose it serves.

What is the most important question to answer when designing a Website?

The most important question that anyone should be asking, is the “why question”. Why do you want to design the website or a website! It should be a prompt within your belief or thought of why it needs to be created.

Why should you use an h1 element over a span element to display a top level heading?

Using the h1 element over a span element to display a top-level heading offers several advantages:
Semantic Meaning:
The h1 element carries semantic meaning, indicating that the enclosed text is the most important heading on the page.
Screen readers and search engines rely on semantic HTML to understand the structure and hierarchy of content, which can impact accessibility and SEO (Search Engine Optimization).
Using h1 appropriately helps convey the significance and context of the content to both users and search engines.
Accessibility:
Screen readers and assistive technologies use heading elements to navigate and understand the content of a webpage.
Properly structured headings (such as h1, h2, etc.) help users with disabilities or impairments navigate through the content more efficiently.
Using semantic HTML elements like h1 improves accessibility by providing clear and meaningful markup.
Styling and Consistency:
Heading elements (h1 to h6) come with default styles provided by web browsers, making it easier to maintain a consistent visual hierarchy across different web pages.
While the appearance of heading elements can be customized with CSS, using semantic HTML ensures consistency in styling and layout.
SEO (Search Engine Optimization):
Search engines use heading elements to understand the structure and relevance of content on a webpage.
Properly structured headings, with the main heading as h1, signal the importance of specific content to search engines.
Using h1 for top-level headings can improve the website's SEO by providing clear and relevant information to search engine crawlers.
Overall, using the h1 element for top-level headings offers both semantic and practical benefits, including improved accessibility, better SEO, and easier styling and maintenance. It helps ensure that the content is well-structured, meaningful, and accessible to all users, regardless of their browsing environment or assistive technology.

What are the benefits of using semantic tags in our HTML?

Screen readers and search engines rely on semantic HTML to understand the structure and hierarchy of content, which can impact accessibility and SEO (Search Engine Optimization).
Using h1 appropriately helps convey the significance and context of the content to both users and search engines.

What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language primarily used for building dynamic and interactive web applications. It is a core technology of the World Wide Web alongside HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). JavaScript allows developers to add behavior, interactivity, and functionality to web pages.

Key features and characteristics of JavaScript include:

Client-Side Scripting: JavaScript is primarily used as a client-side scripting language, meaning it runs in the user's web browser rather than on the web server. This allows for dynamic content generation and interaction without requiring page reloads.

Interactivity and User Experience: JavaScript enables developers to create interactive elements such as dropdown menus, form validation, sliders, accordions, and more, enhancing the user experience of web applications.

DOM Manipulation: JavaScript interacts with the Document Object Model (DOM), a hierarchical representation of the HTML structure of a web page. It can dynamically access, modify, add, or delete elements and content within the DOM, allowing for real-time updates and changes to the web page.

Asynchronous Programming: JavaScript supports asynchronous programming patterns, allowing tasks to be executed independently of the main program flow. This is commonly used for tasks such as fetching data from servers, handling user input, and performing animations without blocking the user interface.

Event-Driven Programming: JavaScript follows an event-driven programming paradigm, where actions or events trigger the execution of specific code. Developers can define event handlers to respond to user interactions like clicks, mouse movements, keypresses, and form submissions.

Cross-Browser Compatibility: JavaScript is supported by all modern web browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and others. It provides a consistent programming interface across different browsers, ensuring compatibility and interoperability.

Versatility and Ecosystem: JavaScript has a large and vibrant ecosystem with a wide range of frameworks, libraries, and tools for web development. Popular frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js provide additional abstractions and features for building complex web applications efficiently.

Describe 2 things that require JavaScript in the Browser?

Form Validation:
JavaScript is often used to validate form input on the client-side before submitting data to the server.
Through JavaScript, developers can define rules and conditions for each form field, such as required fields, minimum and maximum lengths, valid email formats, numeric values, and more.
When a user interacts with the form (e.g., submits or changes input), JavaScript functions are triggered to check the input data against the specified validation criteria.
If the input doesn't meet the validation rules, JavaScript can display error messages dynamically to notify users and prompt them to correct their input before submission.
Form validation with JavaScript enhances user experience by providing immediate feedback and reducing the likelihood of errors when submitting data.
Dynamic Content and Interactivity:
JavaScript enables the creation of dynamic and interactive web pages by manipulating HTML, CSS, and the Document Object Model (DOM) in real-time.
With JavaScript, developers can dynamically update and modify the content of a web page based on user actions, events, or external data sources.

How can you add JavaScript to an HTML document?

To add Java Script into a HTML file; it can be added by External, Internal and Inline.  The External JavaScript, is added by creating a .js file. The internal JavaScript, is done by creating a script tag in the Head Section and the Inline Javascript is created within the Body Section of the HTML file.
