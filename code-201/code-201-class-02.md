## Why is it important to use semantic elements in our HTML?

Using semantic elements in HTML is important for several reasons:

1. **Clarity and Readability:** Semantic elements make the structure of the webpage more understandable, both for developers and for assistive technologies like screen readers used by people with disabilities. For example, `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, `<aside>`, etc., convey the purpose of each section of the webpage clearly.

2. **Search Engine Optimization (SEO):** Search engines use semantic HTML to better understand the content and context of web pages. Using appropriate semantic elements can positively impact a page's search engine ranking.

3. **Accessibility:** Semantic HTML improves accessibility by providing better structure and context for assistive technologies. Screen readers can interpret semantic elements more accurately, helping users with disabilities navigate and understand the content.

4. **Consistency and Maintainability:** Semantic HTML encourages consistency in webpage structure and makes it easier to maintain and update the codebase. Developers can quickly understand the purpose of different sections of code and make changes more efficiently.

5. **Future-proofing:** Semantic elements are part of the HTML standard and are less likely to become outdated or deprecated compared to non-semantic elements or custom attributes. Using semantic HTML helps future-proof the codebase against changes in web standards and browser behavior.

## How many levels of headings are there in HTML?

HTML provides six levels of headings, from `<h1>` to `<h6>`. These elements are used to define the hierarchical structure of a document, with `<h1>` representing the most important heading and `<h6>` representing the least important heading.

## What are some uses for the sup and sub elements?
The `<sup>` and `<sub>` elements in HTML are used to denote superscript and subscript text, respectively. Here are some common use cases for each:

- **sup (Superscript):**
  1. Representing footnotes or endnotes.
  2. Indicating mathematical exponents or powers (e.g., x²).
  3. Denoting references, such as in citations or annotations.
  4. Displaying trademark or copyright symbols in a smaller size (e.g., TM or ©).

- **sub (Subscript):**
  1. Writing chemical formulas, such as H₂O.
  2. Representing mathematical subscripts (e.g., CO₂).
  3. Displaying numeric subscripts, such as in mathematical equations.
  4. Noting component indices in technical or scientific writing.
These elements are useful for maintaining proper typographic conventions and enhancing readability in various contexts.

## When using the abbr element, what attribute must be added to provide the full expansion of the term?

When using the `<abbr>` element in HTML, the `title` attribute must be added to provide the full expansion or explanation of the abbreviation. The `title` attribute contains the full text or description of the abbreviation, which is typically displayed as a tooltip when the user hovers over the abbreviated term. This helps improve accessibility and provides additional context for users who may not be familiar with the abbreviation.

## Why should we avoid using inline styles?
It's generally recommended to avoid using inline styles for the following reasons:

1. **Maintainability:** Inline styles make it harder to maintain and update the styling of a webpage because the CSS rules are scattered throughout the HTML markup. This can lead to code duplication and inconsistencies, especially in larger projects.

2. **Readability:** Inline styles clutter the HTML markup, making it less readable and harder to understand the structure of the document. Separating HTML and CSS improves code readability and maintainability.

3. **Specificity Issues:** Inline styles have higher specificity compared to external and internal stylesheets, which can lead to conflicts and unintended styling overrides. This makes it more difficult to manage the styling of elements consistently across the entire website.

4. **Limited Reusability:** Inline styles are applied directly to individual HTML elements and cannot be easily reused across multiple elements or pages. This reduces code reusability and increases the amount of redundant code.

5. **Accessibility:** Inline styles can make it harder for assistive technologies like screen readers to interpret the content and provide a meaningful experience for users with disabilities.

Overall, using external or internal stylesheets allows for better organization, maintainability, and scalability of the CSS codebase, leading to a more efficient and consistent web development process.

1. ## What is representing the selector?
Selector: The selector in this code is h2. It selects all h2 elements in the HTML document.
2. ## Which components are the CSS declarations?

CSS Declarations: Each line within the curly braces {} represents a CSS declaration. In this code, there are two CSS declarations:
color: black;
padding: 5px;

3.## Which components are considered properties?

Properties: The properties in CSS declarations are the attributes that you want to apply to the selected elements. In this code, the properties are:
color: Sets the text color of the selected h2 elements to black.
padding: Sets the padding (inner spacing) of the selected h2 elements to 5px.
So, to summarize:
The selector (h2) determines which elements the styles will be applied to.
The CSS declarations (color: black; and padding: 5px;) specify the styles to be applied to those selected elements.
The properties (color and padding) are the attributes being styled, such as text color or padding.

## What data type is a sequence of text enclosed in single quote marks?

A sequence of text enclosed in single quote marks (') is typically considered a string data type. In many programming languages, including JavaScript, Python, and others, single quotes (or double quotes " as well) are used to delimit string literals. Strings are used to represent text data, and they can contain any combination of letters, numbers, symbols, and whitespace characters.

## List 4 types of JavaScript operators.

1. Arithmetic Operators: These operators perform arithmetic operations on numeric operands. They include addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and modulo (%) for finding the remainder of a division.

2. Comparison Operators: These operators compare two values and return a Boolean value (true or false) depending on whether the comparison is true or false. They include equality (==, ===, !=, !==), greater than (>), less than (<), greater than or equal to (>=), and less than or equal to (<=).

3. Comparison Operators: These operators compare two values and return a Boolean value (true or false) depending on whether the comparison is true or false. They include equality (==, ===, !=, !==), greater than (>), less than (<), greater than or equal to (>=), and less than or equal to (<=).

4. Assignment Operators: These operators are used to assign values to variables. They include simple assignment (=), as well as compound assignment operators such as addition assignment (+=), subtraction assignment (-=), and others.

## Describe a real world Problem you could solve with a Function.

## An if statement checks a __ and if it evaluates to ___, then the code block will execute.

An if statement checks a condition, and if it evaluates to true, then the code block will execute.

## What is the use of an else if?

The else if statement is used in JavaScript to add additional conditions to an if statement. It allows you to specify alternative conditions to check if the initial if condition evaluates to false.

## List 3 different types of comparison operators.

Equality Operators (== and ===):
==: Checks if two values are equal, but performs type coercion if the operands have different types.
===: Checks if two values are equal and of the same data type, without performing type coercion.
Inequality Operators (!= and !==):
!=: Checks if two values are not equal, but performs type coercion if the operands have different types.
!==: Checks if two values are not equal or of different data types, without performing type coercion.
Relational Operators (<, <=, >, >=):
<: Less than.
<=: Less than or equal to.
>: Greater than.
>=: Greater than or equal to.

These operators are used to compare values and determine the relationship between them, which is often used in conditional statements and expressions in JavaScript programs.

## What is the difference between the logical operator && and ||?

The logical operators && (logical AND) and || (logical OR) are used to perform logical operations on Boolean operands in JavaScript. Here's the difference between them:
1.Logical AND (&&):
The && operator returns true if both operands are true, otherwise it returns false.
It short-circuits evaluation: if the first operand evaluates to false, the second operand is not evaluated because the overall result will be false regardless of its value.
2.Logical OR (||):
The || operator returns true if at least one of the operands is true, otherwise it returns false.
It short-circuits evaluation: if the first operand evaluates to true, the second operand is not evaluated because the overall result will be true regardless of its value.
In summary:
&& returns true only if both operands are true.
|| returns true if at least one of the operands is true.
These logical operators are commonly used in conditional expressions and can help control the flow of execution in JavaScript programs.
