## 1. Why would a developer use local storage for a web application?

Developers may choose to utilize local storage for a web application for several reasons. Firstly, local storage allows for the storage of data directly within the user's web browser, reducing the need for frequent server requests and improving the application's performance by decreasing latency. Additionally, local storage provides a convenient way to store user-specific data such as preferences, settings, or cached information, enabling a more personalized and seamless user experience. Moreover, local storage offers enhanced data security compared to storing sensitive information solely on the client-side, as it is not transmitted over the network and is subject to the browser's same-origin policy, providing a level of protection against cross-site scripting attacks.

## 2. What information should not be stored in local storage?

Sensitive information such as passwords, authentication tokens, credit card details, and personally identifiable information (PII) should not be stored in local storage. Storing such sensitive data in local storage poses a security risk, as it is susceptible to theft through various means such as cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks or malicious browser extensions. Instead, sensitive information should be securely handled using server-side storage mechanisms with appropriate encryption and access controls. It's essential to follow security best practices and adhere to compliance regulations such as GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) or HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) to protect users' privacy and ensure data integrity.

## 3. Local storage can store what type of data? How would you convert it to that type before storing?

Local storage can store data in the form of strings. This includes text, numbers, or any other data that can be represented as a string. Before storing data in local storage, you may need to convert it to a string format using appropriate methods such as JSON.stringify() for JavaScript objects or toString() for other data types like numbers or booleans.
For example, if you have a JavaScript object userData containing user information:
javascript
Copy code
let userData = {
 name: "John",
 age: 30,
 email: ("john@example dot com")
};

You can convert it to a string using JSON.stringify() before storing it in local storage:
javascript
Copy code
localStorage.setItem("userData", JSON.stringify(userData));

This ensures that the object is converted to a string representation and stored in local storage. When retrieving the data from local storage, you can parse the string back into its original format using JSON.parse():
javascript
Copy code
let storedUserData = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("userData"));

This converts the string retrieved from local storage back into a JavaScript object.
