- **Cost**: Higher than T2 Micro but still within the cost-effective range for applications that need better baseline performance and the ability to handle larger bursts.

### Summary of Key Differences

- **Size and Capacity**: T2 XL has significantly more vCPUs (4 vs. 1) and memory (16 GiB vs. 1 GiB) compared to T2 Micro.
- **Performance**: Both instances use the burstable performance model, but T2 XL has a higher baseline performance and can handle more substantial workloads.
- **Use Cases**: T2 Micro is ideal for lightweight, less demanding applications, while T2 XL is better suited for medium-sized applications that need more compute and memory resources.
- **Cost**: T2 Micro is the most budget-friendly option, whereas T2 XL provides better performance for a higher but still cost-effective price.
In summary, the choice between T2 Micro and T2 XL depends on the resource requirements and workload characteristics of your application.
Explain a “Compute Cycle” to a non-technical friend.
Imagine you have a big book that you need to type out on your computer. Each time you press a key on your keyboard, you're doing a little bit of work to get that book typed up. Now, think of a "compute cycle" as one of those key presses.
In more relatable terms, here's how you can explain a compute cycle:

### Compute Cycle Analogy

- **Typing the Book**: Think of your computer as someone typing out a book. Every letter or word typed is like a small task that needs to be completed.
- **Key Press**: Each key press you make to type a letter represents a tiny unit of work. When your computer is doing its job, it's performing lots of these tiny tasks rapidly, one after another.
- **Compute Cycle**: A compute cycle is like one of those key presses. It's a single, small step your computer takes to process information.

### Putting it Together

When your computer runs a program, it needs to perform thousands, millions, or even billions of these small steps (compute cycles) to complete the task. Just like typing out an entire book requires many key presses, running a computer program requires many compute cycles.

### Why It Matters

- **Speed**: The faster your computer can perform these cycles, the quicker it can complete tasks.
- **Efficiency**: Efficient programs need fewer compute cycles to get the job done, just like a good typist needs fewer keystrokes because they don't make as many mistakes.
So, a compute cycle is just a basic unit of work your computer does, much like each key press is a basic unit of typing out a book.
