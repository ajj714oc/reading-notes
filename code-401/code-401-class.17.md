## Describe “serverless” to a non-technical friend

Sure, imagine you're hosting a big party at your house. Normally, you'd have to plan everything: from arranging chairs and tables to making sure there's enough food and drinks for everyone. You'd also have to be ready for unexpected guests and make sure everything runs smoothly.
Now, let's think of your house as a server. Traditionally, when you host something online, like a website or an app, you need to rent space on a server, just like you'd prepare your house for a party. You have to manage everything: from setting up the server to maintaining it, making sure it's secure, and handling any unexpected spikes in visitors.
But with "serverless," it's like having a magical party planner who takes care of everything for you. You don't need to worry about renting a server or managing it. Instead, you focus on the fun part: your website or app. When someone visits your site, this magical party planner (in this case, a service like AWS Lambda) automatically handles all the technical stuff behind the scenes, making sure everything runs smoothly and efficiently.
So, "serverless" doesn't mean there are no servers involved. Instead, it means you don't have to worry about them. You can just focus on creating your website or app, and the serverless platform takes care of the rest, making it easier and more cost-effective for you. It's like hosting a party without the hassle of being the host!
CDN

## What is a CDN?

A CDN, or Content Delivery Network, is a network of distributed servers strategically positioned in various locations around the world. The primary purpose of a CDN is to deliver web content, such as images, videos, scripts, and other static or dynamic assets, to users more quickly and efficiently.

Here's how a CDN works:

1.**Content Distribution**: When you host your website or application, the files that make up your content are stored on a web server in a specific location, known as the origin server.
2.**Server Distribution**: A CDN provider replicates these files and caches them on multiple servers across different geographical locations, known as edge servers or points of presence (PoPs).
3.**User Access**: When a user requests content from your website or application, the CDN automatically determines the user's location and serves the requested files from the edge server closest to them.
4.**Caching and Optimization**: The CDN caches frequently accessed content on its edge servers, reducing the load on the origin server and improving response times. It also optimizes content delivery by compressing files, minifying scripts, and leveraging techniques like browser caching and HTTP/2.
5.**Dynamic Content Acceleration**: In addition to static content, some CDNs offer acceleration for dynamic content, such as personalized web pages or API responses. They achieve this by using techniques like edge computing and dynamic content caching.
By distributing content across multiple edge servers and serving it from locations closer to users, CDNs help reduce latency, improve website performance, and enhance the overall user experience. They are commonly used by websites, e-commerce platforms, media streaming services, and other online applications to deliver content reliably and efficiently to global audiences.

## How does a CDN work with relation to the website visitor?

When a website visitor interacts with a website that utilizes a CDN (Content Delivery Network), the CDN enhances the experience by optimizing content delivery. Here's how it works from the perspective of the website visitor:

1.**DNS Resolution**: When a visitor enters a website's URL into their browser, the browser initiates a DNS (Domain Name System) lookup to translate the domain name ( e.g., example.com ) into an IP address. The DNS resolver, which could be provided by the visitor's ISP or another DNS service, retrieves the IP address associated with the website.
2.**CDN Routing**: If the website uses a CDN, the DNS resolver returns the IP address of the CDN edge server closest to the visitor's location instead of the origin server's IP address. This is achieved through DNS techniques like geo-routing or anycast, which direct the visitor to the optimal edge server based on their geographic location.
3.**Request to CDN Edge Server**: The visitor's browser sends an HTTP request for the website's content (e.g., HTML files, images, scripts) to the CDN edge server identified by the DNS resolver.
4.**Content Delivery**: The CDN edge server receives the request and checks its cache to see if it already has a copy of the requested content. If the content is cached locally and is still fresh (not expired), the edge server can immediately serve it to the visitor without needing to fetch it from the origin server.
5.**Origin Server Interaction (if needed)**: If the requested content is not cached at the edge server or if the cache has expired, the edge server forwards the request to the origin server where the website is hosted. The origin server retrieves the requested content and sends it back to the edge server.
6.**Content Delivery (continued)**: The edge server caches the content obtained from the origin server and serves it to the visitor's browser. Subsequent requests for the same content from other visitors in the same geographic region can be served directly from the edge server's cache, improving response times and reducing load on the origin server.
7.**Dynamic Content Handling**: In addition to caching static content, some CDNs can handle dynamic content by executing server-side code (e.g., AWS Lambda functions) at the edge. This allows for personalized or dynamically generated content to be delivered quickly to visitors.
8.**Optimizations and Security**: CDNs often provide additional optimizations such as content compression, image optimization, and protocol optimization to further enhance performance. They may also offer security features like DDoS protection, web application firewall (WAF), and SSL/TLS encryption to protect against cyber threats.
By leveraging a CDN, website owners can improve the speed, reliability, and security of content delivery to visitors worldwide, resulting in a better overall user experience.

## What are the benefits of employing a CDN?

Employing a Content Delivery Network (CDN) offers several benefits for website owners and users alike:
1.**Improved Website Performance**: CDNs reduce latency by caching content closer to users' geographic locations. This results in faster page load times and a smoother browsing experience, especially for visitors located far from the website's origin server.
2.**Global Reach**: CDNs have a distributed network of edge servers located in multiple geographic regions. This allows websites to deliver content to users worldwide with minimal delay, regardless of their location.
3.**Increased Scalability**: CDNs can handle spikes in website traffic more effectively by distributing the load across multiple servers. This helps prevent server overload and ensures consistent performance during periods of high demand, such as during marketing campaigns or seasonal traffic peaks.
4.**Bandwidth Savings**: CDNs reduce the bandwidth usage on the origin server by serving cached content directly from edge servers. This can result in significant cost savings, particularly for websites with high traffic volumes or large media files.
5.**Enhanced Security**: CDNs offer security features such as DDoS protection, web application firewall (WAF), and SSL/TLS encryption to protect websites from cyber threats and attacks. By filtering malicious traffic and encrypting data in transit, CDNs help safeguard sensitive information and maintain the integrity of the website.
6.**Improved SEO Ranking**: Faster page load times, which are facilitated by CDNs, contribute to better user experience and can positively impact a website's search engine ranking. Search engines like Google consider page speed as a ranking factor, so faster websites may rank higher in search results.
7.**Better User Experience**: Faster load times, reduced latency, and improved performance contribute to a better overall user experience. Visitors are more likely to stay on a website that loads quickly and smoothly, leading to increased engagement, lower bounce rates, and higher conversion rates.
8.**Reliability and Redundancy**: CDNs offer redundancy and failover capabilities by distributing content across multiple edge servers. If one server fails or becomes unavailable, traffic can be automatically rerouted to another server, ensuring uninterrupted access to the website.
Overall, employing a CDN can significantly enhance website performance, scalability, security, and user experience, making it a valuable investment for businesses of all sizes.
