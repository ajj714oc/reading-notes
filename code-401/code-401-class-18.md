## What two API types might you choose from?

Two common API types that you might choose from are:

1.**RESTful APIs**: Representational State Transfer (REST) APIs are a popular architectural style for designing networked applications. RESTful APIs are based on a set of principles, including stateless communication, resource-based URLs, and standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.). These APIs use HTTP requests to perform operations on resources, such as retrieving data (GET), creating new resources (POST), updating existing resources (PUT), or deleting resources (DELETE). RESTful APIs are widely used for building web services, mobile backends, and integrations between systems.
2.**GraphQL APIs**: GraphQL is a query language and runtime for APIs developed by Facebook. Unlike traditional RESTful APIs, which expose predefined endpoints for specific resources, GraphQL APIs allow clients to request only the data they need using a single flexible endpoint. Clients can specify their data requirements in a GraphQL query, and the server responds with the requested data in the exact shape and structure defined by the query. This enables clients to retrieve complex data structures in a more efficient and predictable manner, reducing over-fetching and under-fetching of data. GraphQL

APIs are particularly well-suited for applications with complex data requirements, such as social networks, content management systems, and data-driven applications.

Both RESTful APIs and GraphQL APIs have their strengths and weaknesses, and the choice between them depends on factors such as the nature of your application, the complexity of your data model, the requirements of your clients, and your team's familiarity with each technology.
