Web Sockets
What is a Web Socket?
A WebSocket is a communication protocol that provides full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection. It is designed to be implemented in web browsers and web servers, but it can be used by any client or server application. Here are some key points about WebSockets:

1. **Full-Duplex Communication**: WebSockets allow for two-way communication between a client and server, meaning both can send and receive data simultaneously without the need for multiple HTTP requests.
2. **Persistent Connection**: Unlike HTTP, which is stateless and typically involves opening a new connection for each request/response pair, a WebSocket connection remains open, enabling real-time data transfer.
3. **Protocol Upgrade**: A WebSocket connection starts as an HTTP connection. The client sends an HTTP request to the server to upgrade the connection to WebSocket. If the server supports WebSockets, it will agree to the upgrade, and the connection will switch to the WebSocket protocol.
4. **Low Latency**: Due to the persistent nature of WebSocket connections, they can achieve lower latency compared to HTTP polling or long-polling, making them ideal for applications requiring real-time updates, such as online gaming, chat applications, and live data feeds.

## How WebSockets Work

1.**Handshake**: The client initiates a WebSocket connection by sending a request to the server, including an "Upgrade" header to indicate the desire to establish a WebSocket connection.
   Example HTTP request headers for a WebSocket upgrade:

   GET /chat HTTP/1.1
   Host: server.example.com
   Upgrade: websocket
   Connection: Upgrade
   Sec-WebSocket-Key: dGhlIHNhbXBsZSBub25jZQ==
   Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13

2.**Server Response**: If the server supports WebSockets, it responds with headers agreeing to the upgrade.
   Example HTTP response headers:

   HTTP/1.1 101 Switching Protocols
   Upgrade: websocket
   Connection: Upgrade
   Sec-WebSocket-Accept: s3pPLMBiTxaQ9kYGzzhZRbK+xOo=

3.**Data Transfer**: Once the connection is established, data frames can be sent back and forth between the client and server. These frames are smaller and more efficient than typical HTTP messages.

### Use Cases

- **Real-Time Applications**: WebSockets are commonly used in applications that require real-time updates such as live sports scores, stock tickers, and social media feeds.
- **Online Gaming**: Enables real-time interaction between players.
- **Chat Applications**: Facilitates real-time communication between users.
- **Collaborative Editing**: Allows multiple users to edit documents simultaneously with immediate updates.

### Example of WebSocket in JavaScript

Here's a simple example of a WebSocket client in JavaScript:

javascript

// Create a new WebSocket connection
const socket = new WebSocket('ws://example.com/socket');
// Event listener for when the connection is established
socket.addEventListener('open', (event) => {
    console.log('WebSocket is open now.');
    socket.send('Hello Server!');
});
// Event listener for receiving messages from the server
socket.addEventListener('message', (event) => {
    console.log('Message from server ', event.data);
});
// Event listener for when the connection is closed
socket.addEventListener('close', (event) => {
    console.log('WebSocket is closed now.');
});
// Event listener for handling errors
socket.addEventListener('error', (event) => {
    console.error('WebSocket error: ', event);
});

In this example, a WebSocket connection is established to a server at `ws://example.com/socket`, and various event listeners are set up to handle the connection lifecycle and incoming messages.
WebSockets provide an efficient and robust way to enable real-time, bidirectional communication between clients and servers, making them a critical component for modern web applications that require interactive and dynamic user experiences.
Describe the Web Socket request/response handshake and what happens once the connection is established.
The WebSocket handshake process is an initial exchange of HTTP headers between the client and server to establish a WebSocket connection. Once the handshake is successful, the connection is upgraded to a WebSocket connection, enabling full-duplex communication. Here is a detailed description of the handshake process and what happens afterward:

### WebSocket Handshake Process

#### Client Request

The client initiates the handshake by sending an HTTP request to the server. This request includes headers that specify the client's intention to upgrade to a WebSocket connection. Key headers in this request include:

- **GET /path HTTP/1.1**: The HTTP method and path.
- **Host**: The server's domain name.
- **Upgrade**: Specifies that the client wants to upgrade to the WebSocket protocol (`websocket`).
- **Connection**: Indicates that the connection should be upgraded (`Upgrade`).
- **Sec-WebSocket-Key**: A base64-encoded random value. This is used by the server to prove that it received the client's request.
- **Sec-WebSocket-Version**: The WebSocket protocol version the client supports (typically `13`).

Example client request headers:

GET /chat HTTP/1.1
Host: server.example.com
Upgrade: websocket
Connection: Upgrade
Sec-WebSocket-Key: dGhlIHNhbXBsZSBub25jZQ==
Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13

#### Server Response

The server responds to the client's request with an HTTP response if it agrees to establish the WebSocket connection. The key headers in the server's response include:

- **HTTP/1.1 101 Switching Protocols**: The HTTP status code indicating the protocol switch.
- **Upgrade**: Echoes the `websocket` value, indicating the server agrees to the protocol upgrade.
- **Connection**: Echoes the `Upgrade` value.
- **Sec-WebSocket-Accept**: A hashed value generated from the client's `Sec-WebSocket-Key` combined with a specific GUID, proving that the server is able to handle WebSocket connections.

Example server response headers:

HTTP/1.1 101 Switching Protocols
Upgrade: websocket
Connection: Upgrade
Sec-WebSocket-Accept: s3pPLMBiTxaQ9kYGzzhZRbK+xOo=

### Establishing the WebSocket Connection

Once the server sends the `101 Switching Protocols` response, the HTTP connection is upgraded to a WebSocket connection. From this point onward, the communication between the client and server takes place using the WebSocket protocol, which operates over the same TCP connection.

### After the Connection is Established

1.**Data Frames**: Communication occurs through WebSocket frames. There are different types of frames, such as text frames, binary frames, ping/pong frames (for keep-alive), and close frames (to terminate the connection).
2.**Full-Duplex Communication**: Both the client and the server can send messages to each other independently. The connection remains open, allowing for continuous data exchange without the overhead of repeatedly establishing new connections.
3.**Message Handling**:

- **Text Frame**: Typically used to send textual data (UTF-8 encoded text).
  - **Binary Frame**: Used for sending binary data.
  - **Ping/Pong Frame**: Used for keep-alive purposes to check if the connection is still active.
  - **Close Frame**: Sent by either the client or the server to initiate the closing of the connection. The other party should respond with a close frame to acknowledge the closure.

### Example of WebSocket Communication in JavaScript

Once the WebSocket connection is established, you can use JavaScript to handle the communication. Here’s an example:

javascript

// Create a new WebSocket connection
const socket = new WebSocket('ws://server.example.com/path');
// Event listener for when the connection is established
socket.addEventListener('open', (event) => {
    console.log('WebSocket connection opened');
    // Send a message to the server
    socket.send('Hello Server!');
});
// Event listener for receiving messages from the server
socket.addEventListener('message', (event) => {
    console.log('Message from server: ', event.data);
});
// Event listener for when the connection is closed
socket.addEventListener('close', (event) => {
    console.log('WebSocket connection closed');
});
// Event listener for handling errors
socket.addEventListener('error', (event) => {
    console.error('WebSocket error: ', event);
});

### Summary

- **Handshake**: Initiated by the client with an HTTP request containing specific headers. The server responds with `101 Switching Protocols` if it agrees to the upgrade.
- **Connection**: Once established, allows for full-duplex communication using WebSocket frames over the same TCP connection.
- **Communication**: Involves sending and receiving different types of frames to exchange data, maintain the connection, and handle closure.

Socket.io Tutorial
What does the event handler io.on() do?
The `io.on()` event handler is commonly used in the context of the Socket.IO library, which is a popular JavaScript library for real-time web applications. Socket.IO provides an abstraction over WebSockets, enabling easier implementation of real-time communication.
The `io.on()` method is used to listen for and handle various events. Here’s a detailed explanation of how it works:

### Basic Usage

1. **Listening for Connection Events**:
   - The most common use of `io.on()` is to listen for incoming connections from clients.
   - When a client connects to the server, a `connection` event is emitted, and the provided callback function is executed.

javascript

const io = require('socket.io')(server);
io.on('connection', (socket) => {
    console.log('A user connected');
    // Additional event listeners and handlers for this connection can be added here
    socket.on('disconnect', () => {
        console.log('User disconnected');
    });
});

### Handling Custom Events

2.**Listening for Custom Events**:

- Inside the `connection` event handler, you can set up additional event listeners for custom events emitted by the client.

javascript
io.on('connection', (socket) => {
    console.log('A user connected');
    // Listening for a custom event named 'chat message'
    socket.on('chat message', (msg) => {
        console.log('Message received: ' + msg);  
        // Broadcasting the message to all connected clients
        io.emit('chat message', msg);
    });
    socket.on('disconnect', () => {
        console.log('User disconnected');
    });
});

### Explanation

- **`io.on('event', callback)`**:
  - `io`: Refers to the Socket.IO server instance.
  - `on`: Method used to register an event listener.
  - `'event'`: Name of the event to listen for (e.g., `'connection'`, `'chat message'`).
  - `callback`: Function to be executed when the event occurs. This function receives arguments specific to the event (e.g., the `socket` object for `'connection'` events).
- **`socket.on('event', callback)`**:
  - `socket`: Represents the individual client's connection to the server.
  - `on`: Method used to register an event listener for this specific client.
  - `'event'`: Name of the custom event to listen for (e.g., `'chat message'`).
  - `callback`: Function to be executed when the custom event occurs, receiving data sent by the client (e.g., the message string).

### Real-World Example

In a chat application, the server listens for connections and messages from clients. When a message is received, it can be broadcast to all connected clients.

javascript

const io = require('socket.io')(server);
io.on('connection', (socket) => {
    console.log('A user connected');
    socket.on('chat message', (msg) => {
        console.log('Message received: ' + msg);
        io.emit('chat message', msg); // Broadcast message to all clients
    });
    socket.on('disconnect', () => {
        console.log('User disconnected');
    });
});

In this example:

- When a client connects, a message is logged to the console.
- The server listens for `chat message` events from connected clients.
- When a `chat message` event is received, the server logs the message and broadcasts it to all connected clients using `io.emit()`.
- When a client disconnects, a message is logged to the console.
The `io.on()` and `socket.on()` methods together facilitate real-time, event-driven communication between the server and clients using the Socket.IO library.
Describe some possible proof of life or proof that the code works as expected
To demonstrate that the code using `io.on()` with Socket.IO works as expected, you can implement and observe several "proof of life" techniques. These proofs involve verifying that the server correctly handles connections, events, and communication with clients. Here are some approaches:

### 1. **Console Logging**

Adding console logs at key points in your code can help you verify that events are being triggered and handled correctly.
**Server-Side Code**:

javascript

const io = require('socket.io')(server);
io.on('connection', (socket) => {
    console.log('A user connected');
    socket.on('chat message', (msg) => {
        console.log('Message received: ' + msg);
        io.emit('chat message', msg); // Broadcast message to all clients
    });
    socket.on('disconnect', () => {
        console.log('User disconnected');
    });
});

**Expected Behavior**:

- When a client connects, you should see "A user connected" in the server console.
- When a client sends a chat message, you should see "Message received: < message > in the server console.
- When a client disconnects, you should see "User disconnected" in the server console.

### 2. **Client-Side Logging**

Similarly, adding logs in the client-side code helps verify that the client is correctly connecting to the server and receiving messages.
**Client-Side Code** (e.g., in a web browser):

html
<!DOCTYPE html>

< html >

< head >
    < title>Socket.IO Chat</title>
    < script src="/socket.io/socket.io.js"></script>
    < script>
        document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', (event) => {
            const socket = io();
            socket.on('connect', () => {
                console.log('Connected to server');
            });
            socket.on('chat message', (msg) => {
                console.log('Message from server: ' + msg);
            });
            socket.on('disconnect', () => {
                console.log('Disconnected from server');
            });
            // Example of sending a message to the server
            document.getElementById('sendButton').addEventListener('click', () => {
                const message = document.getElementById('messageInput').value;
                socket.send('chat message', message);
            });
        });
    </script>
</head>
< body >

    <input id="messageInput" type="text" placeholder="Type your message here" />
    <button id="sendButton">Send</button>
</body>
</html>

**Expected Behavior**:

- When the page loads, you should see "Connected to server" in the browser console.
- When a message is received from the server, you should see "Message from server: < message > in the browser console.
- When the client disconnects, you should see "Disconnected from server" in the browser console.

### 3. **Testing with Multiple Clients**

Running multiple clients and ensuring they receive broadcast messages can validate the real-time communication aspect.
**Steps**:

1.Open multiple browser windows or tabs pointing to your client application.
2.Connect each client to the server.
3.Send a message from one client.
4.Verify that all connected clients (including the sender) receive the broadcast message.
**Expected Behavior**:

- All connected clients display the received message, demonstrating that the server is correctly broadcasting to all clients.

### 4. **Network Monitoring Tools**

Using network monitoring tools (like browser developer tools or Wireshark) to inspect WebSocket frames can provide low-level confirmation of data being sent and received.
**Steps**:

1. Open the browser's developer tools (usually F12).
2. Go to the Network tab and filter by "WS" (WebSocket).
3. Observe the WebSocket connection and frames being exchanged.
4. Verify that messages sent by the client are seen in the network tool and that broadcast messages are received by all clients.
**Expected Behavior**:

- WebSocket frames show the correct messages being sent and received, matching the application logic.

### 5. **Automated Testing**

For a more robust proof, you can write automated tests using tools like Mocha, Chai, and Sinon for server-side code, and tools like Selenium or Cypress for end-to-end testing.
**Server-Side Test Example**:

javascript

const io = require('socket.io-client');
const expect = require('chai').expect;
describe('Socket.IO server', () => {
    let clientSocket;
    before((done) => {
        clientSocket = io(' http:// localhost: 3000' );
        clientSocket.on('connect', done);
    });
    after(() => {
        clientSocket.close();
    });
    it('should receive message from server', (done) => {
        clientSocket.on('chat message', (msg) => {
            expect(msg).to.equal('test message');
            done();
        });
        io.emit('chat message', 'test message');
    });
});

Summary

Using these methods, you can confirm that your Socket.IO implementation works as expected:

- Console logging for basic verification.
- Client-side logging to ensure clients are connected and receiving data.
- Testing with multiple clients to verify real-time communication.
- Network monitoring tools to inspect WebSocket frames.
- Automated tests for comprehensive validation.
What does socket.emit() do?
The `socket.emit()` function in Socket.IO is used to send an event and associated data from one side of the connection (client or server) to the other. This method can be used to communicate various types of events and data, enabling real-time interactions in web applications.

### Usage

#### Server-Side Example

On the server side, `socket.emit()` is typically used to send data to a specific client that has connected to the server.

javascript

const io = require('socket.io')(server);
io.on('connection', (socket) => {
    console.log('A user connected');
    // Send a message to the client
    socket.emit('welcome', 'Welcome to the server!');
    // Handle custom events from the client
    socket.on('chat message', (msg) => {
        console.log('Message from client: ' + msg);
    });
    socket.on('disconnect', () => {
        console.log('User disconnected');
    });
});

In this example:

- When a client connects, the server sends a "welcome" message to that client using `socket.emit('welcome', 'Welcome to the server!')`.

#### Client-Side Example

On the client side, `socket.emit()` is used to send data to the server.

html

<!DOCTYPE html>

< html >
< head >
    < title >Socket.IO Client</title>
    < script src="/socket.io/socket.io.js"></script>
    < script >
        document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', (event) => {
            const socket = io();
            socket.on('connect', () => {
                console.log('Connected to server');
                // Send a message to the server
                socket.emit('chat message', 'Hello, server!');
            });
            socket.on('welcome', (msg) => {
                console.log('Message from server: ' + msg);
            });
            socket.on('disconnect', () => {
                console.log('Disconnected from server');
            });
        });
    </script>
</head>
< body >
    < h1 >Socket.IO Client</h1>
</body>
</html>

In this example:

- When the client connects to the server, it sends a "chat message" event with the data 'Hello, server!' using `socket.emit('chat message', 'Hello, server!')`.
- The client listens for the "welcome" event from the server and logs the received message.

### Event Handling

Both the client and server can emit and listen for custom events. The event name can be any string, and the data sent with the event can be of any type.

### Example of Bidirectional Communication

#### Server-Side Code

javascript

const io = require('socket.io')(server);
io.on('connection', (socket) => {
    console.log('A user connected');
    // Send a message to the client upon connection
    socket.emit('welcome', 'Welcome to the server!');
    // Handle 'chat message' event from the client
    socket.on('chat message', (msg) => {
        console.log('Message from client: ' + msg);
        // Broadcast the message to all clients, including the sender
        io.emit('chat message', msg);
    });
    socket.on('disconnect', () => {
        console.log('User disconnected');
    });
});

#### Client-Side Code

html

<!DOCTYPE html>
< html >
< head >
    < title>Socket.IO Chat</title>
    < script src="/socket.io/socket.io.js"></script>
    < script>
        document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', (event) => {
            const socket = io();
            socket.on('connect', () => {
                console.log('Connected to server');
                socket.emit('chat message', 'Hello, server!');
            });
            socket.on('welcome', (msg) => {
                console.log('Message from server: ' + msg);
            });
            socket.on('chat message', (msg) => {
                console.log('Message from server: ' + msg);
            });
            socket.on('disconnect', () => {
                console.log('Disconnected from server');
            });
            // Sending a message from the client interface
            document.getElementById('sendButton').addEventListener('click', () => {
                const message = document.getElementById('messageInput').value;
                socket.emit('chat message', message);
            });
        });
    </script>
</head>
< body>
    < input id="messageInput" type="text" placeholder="Type your message here" />
    < button id="sendButton">Send</button>
</body>
</html>

In this more comprehensive example:

- The server emits a "welcome" event when a client connects.
- The client listens for the "welcome" event and logs the message.
- The client sends a "chat message" event to the server when the page loads and when the user clicks the "Send" button.
- The server listens for "chat message" events from any client and broadcasts these messages to all connected clients using `io.emit('chat message', msg)`.
- All clients listen for "chat message" events and log the received messages.

Summary

- `socket.emit(eventName, data)`: Sends an event with associated data from the client to the server or from the server to a specific client.
- Custom events can be used to implement various types of real-time communication.
- Both client and server can emit and listen for these events, enabling bidirectional communication.
This function is a fundamental part of enabling real-time, interactive applications using Socket.IO.
Socket.io vs Web Sockets
What is the difference between WebSocket and Socket.IO? (think Git and GitHub, or OAuth and Auth0).
WebSocket and Socket.IO serve related but distinct purposes in enabling real-time, bidirectional communication between clients and servers. To understand their differences, it's helpful to think of WebSocket as the underlying protocol and Socket.IO as a higher-level library built on top of that protocol. This relationship is somewhat analogous to how Git and GitHub, or OAuth and Auth0, relate to each other.

### WebSocket

**WebSocket** is a protocol standardized by the IETF as RFC 6455. Here are its key characteristics:

- **Low-Level Protocol**: WebSocket provides a low-level, full-duplex communication channel over a single TCP connection.
- **Native Support**: It is natively supported by most modern web browsers and can be used directly via JavaScript.
- **Efficiency**: WebSocket is designed for efficient, low-latency communication, with minimal overhead compared to HTTP.
- **Implementation Complexity**: While powerful, using WebSocket directly requires managing many aspects of the connection manually, such as reconnections, fallbacks, and message parsing.

### Socket.IO

**Socket.IO** is a JavaScript library built on top of WebSocket (and other transport mechanisms) to simplify real-time web application development. Here are its key characteristics:

- **Higher-Level Abstraction**: Socket.IO provides a higher-level API that abstracts many complexities of working directly with WebSocket.
- **Features and Enhancements**:
  - **Automatic Reconnection**: Automatically tries to reconnect if the connection is lost.
  - **Fallback Mechanisms**: Uses other transport protocols (like HTTP long-polling) when WebSocket is not available.
  - **Event-Based Communication**: Allows communication via custom events, making it easier to implement complex interactions.
  - **Namespaces and Rooms**: Supports organizing communication channels into namespaces and rooms for more granular control.
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Ensures that real-time communication works consistently across different browsers and environments.
- **Middleware Support**: Enables the use of middleware functions for authentication, authorization, and other purposes.

### Analogies

- **Git vs. GitHub**:
  - **Git** is a version control system used for tracking changes in source code. It's a low-level tool that developers use to manage code repositories.
  - **GitHub** is a platform built on top of Git, offering additional features such as hosting repositories, pull requests, issues, and an integrated web interface.
  - Similarly, **WebSocket** is the low-level protocol, while **Socket.IO** is the higher-level library that provides additional features and ease of use.
- **OAuth vs. Auth0**:
  - **OAuth** is an open standard for access delegation, commonly used for token-based authentication and authorization.
  - **Auth0** is a platform that implements OAuth (and other standards), providing a user-friendly interface, additional features, and integrations for managing authentication and authorization.
  - Similarly, **WebSocket** is the protocol standard, while **Socket.IO** is the library that builds on top of it, offering a richer feature set and simplifying implementation.

### Practical Example

Here’s a quick comparison of basic usage in both:
**Using WebSocket Directly**:

javascript

// Client-side WebSocket
const socket = new WebSocket('ws://example.com/socket');
// Handle connection open
socket.addEventListener('open', (event) => {
    socket.send('Hello Server!');
});
// Handle incoming messages
socket.addEventListener('message', (event) => {
    console.log('Message from server:', event.data);
});
// Handle connection close
socket.addEventListener('close', (event) => {
    console.log('Disconnected from server');
});

**Using Socket.IO**:

javascript

// Client-side Socket.IO
const socket = io('http:// example.com ');
// Handle connection open
socket.on('connect', () => {
    socket.emit('chat message', 'Hello Server!');
});
// Handle incoming messages
socket.on('chat message', (msg) => {
    console.log('Message from server:', msg);
});
// Handle connection close
socket.on('disconnect', () => {
    console.log('Disconnected from server');
});

Summary

- **WebSocket**: A low-level, efficient protocol for real-time communication, requiring manual management of connection details.
- **Socket.IO**: A higher-level library that simplifies real-time communication by providing features like automatic reconnection, fallback mechanisms, event-based communication, and more.
By using Socket.IO, developers can leverage the power of WebSocket with additional conveniences, much like using GitHub for managing Git repositories or Auth0 for implementing OAuth.
When would you use Socket.IO?

### Example: Simple Real-Time Chat Application

**Server-Side Code (Node.js)**:

javascript

const io = require('socket.io')(server);
io.on('connection', (socket) => {
    console.log('A user connected');
    socket.on('chat message', (msg) => {
        io.emit('chat message', msg);
    });
    socket.on('disconnect', () => {
        console.log('User disconnected');
    });
});

**Client-Side Code**:

html

<!DOCTYPE html>
< html>
< head>
    < title>Socket.IO Chat</title>
    < script src="/socket.io/socket.io.js"></script>
    < script>
        document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
            const socket = io();
            socket.on('connect', () => {
                console.log('Connected to server');
            });
            socket.on('chat message', (msg) => {
                const item = document.createElement('li');
                item.textContent = msg;
                document.getElementById('messages').appendChild(item);
            });
            socket.on('disconnect', () => {
                console.log('Disconnected from server');
            });
            document.getElementById('sendButton').addEventListener('click', () => {
                const message = document.getElementById('messageInput').value;
                socket.emit('chat message', message);
            });
        });
    </script>
</head>
< body>
    < ul id="messages"></ul>
    < input id="messageInput" type="text" placeholder="Type your message here" />
    < button id="sendButton">Send</button>
</body>
</html>

In this example:

- **Server-Side**: Listens for 'chat message' events from clients and broadcasts them to all connected clients.
- **Client-Side**: Sends 'chat message' events to the server and displays incoming messages in a list.

### Conclusion

Socket.IO is an ideal choice for applications that require robust real-time communication with additional features such as automatic reconnection, fallback mechanisms, and an easy-to-use event-driven API. It abstracts the complexities of WebSocket, providing a more developer-friendly environment for building interactive and real-time web applications.

TCP Handshakes Explained
Translate the gist of this video to a non-technical friend
Imagine you’re making a new friend and want to start a conversation. Before you can start talking and sharing information, you both need to agree that you’re ready to chat. This is similar to how computers establish a connection over the internet using something called a "TCP handshake."
Here’s a simple way to understand the TCP handshake:

1. **First Step: Saying Hello (SYN)**
   - Imagine you wave to your new friend to say, “Hey, I’d like to talk to you!”
   - In computer terms, this is called sending a SYN (synchronize) message.
2. **Second Step: Replying Hello (SYN-ACK)**
   - Your friend sees your wave and waves back, saying, “Hey, I see you want to talk. I’m ready too!”
   - This is like the computer replying with a SYN-ACK (synchronize-acknowledge) message.
3. **Third Step: Confirmation (ACK)**
   - You see your friend’s wave and respond with a thumbs up, meaning, “Great, we both want to chat. Let’s start!”
   - The computer sends back an ACK (acknowledge) message.
After these three steps, you both know you’re ready to communicate, and you can start your conversation smoothly. Computers do the same thing with the TCP handshake to ensure they’re both ready to send and receive data. This helps make sure your internet activities, like browsing websites or streaming videos, happen without interruptions or misunderstandings.

What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?
After reviewing the README, my main learning goals would be to understand the fundamentals of network communication, specifically focusing on TCP/IP, WebSocket protocol, and Socket.io library.
Here's a breakdown of what I aim to learn:
1.**Understanding OSI Networking Model**: This model helps organize and understand how data flows through a network, from physical transmission to high-level application interactions.
2.**TCP and UDP Protocols**: These are two key protocols used for communication over the internet, each with its own characteristics and use cases.
3.**WebSocket Protocol**: This protocol allows for bidirectional communication between a client and a server over a single TCP connection, enabling real-time data transfer.
4.**Socket.io Library**: This library facilitates real-time, full-duplex communication between clients and web servers. It builds on top of WebSocket protocol and provides additional features like broadcasting and namespacing.
5.**Implementing Socket.io Server**: I want to be able to set up a standalone Socket.io server and handle events and real-time messaging effectively.
6.**Event Handling in Socket.io**: Learning how to properly route incoming messages and payloads using events in Socket.io.
By understanding these concepts and being able to implement them practically, I'll be better equipped to build real-time, interactive web applications that require efficient communication between clients and servers.
